# Kahoot: Week 2 - Tool Calling

## Question 1: Why is Bash considered the most important tool for Claude Code?

- ☐ It's the only tool that can access the internet
- ☐ Bash is faster than all other programming languages
- ☒ LLMs were trained extensively on bash commands, making them highly proficient at using it
- ☐ Bash is required by the Claude API to function

## Question 2: What is the correct sequence of the Tool Calling Loop?

- ☒ Think → Select Tool → Execute → Observe → Think Again
- ☐ Select Tool → Think → Execute → Observe → Done
- ☐ Execute → Observe → Think → Select Tool → Report
- ☐ Observe → Think → Select Tool → Execute → Summarize

## Question 3: What are the four stages of the Data Analysis Loop?

- ☐ Collect → Clean → Analyze → Report
- ☐ Query → Filter → Visualize → Present
- ☒ Monitor → Explore → Craft Story → Impact
- ☐ Ingest → Transform → Model → Deploy

## Question 4: How does on-demand context retrieval reduce costs compared to stuffing all data into the prompt?

- ☐ It doesn't — both approaches cost the same
- ☒ From $1.00 to $0.25 per analysis by retrieving only what's needed
- ☐ It's actually more expensive but produces better results
- ☐ From $10.00 to $5.00 per analysis

## Question 5: Which research workflow pattern does Claude use for web research?

- ☐ Download → Parse → Summarize
- ☐ Scrape → Index → Query
- ☒ WebSearch → WebFetch → Synthesize
- ☐ Browse → Bookmark → Report

## Question 6: What type of database is used in the workshop for hands-on exercises?

- ☐ A PostgreSQL database with customer data
- ☒ A SQLite database (startup-funding.db) with startups, investors, and funding rounds
- ☐ A MongoDB database with marketing leads
- ☐ A MySQL database with sales transactions

## Question 7: In the Data Analysis Loop, what does the "Monitor" stage involve?

- ☐ Setting up real-time dashboards
- ☐ Watching server logs for errors
- ☒ Running aggregation queries to spot anomalies and patterns
- ☐ Monitoring competitor pricing changes

## Question 8: Which SQL pattern is highlighted as useful for data analysis with AI agents?

- ☐ Simple SELECT * FROM table queries
- ☐ Stored procedures and triggers
- ☒ CTEs, window functions, and cohort analysis
- ☐ Database views and materialized views
