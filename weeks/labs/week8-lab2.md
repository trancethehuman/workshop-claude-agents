---

## Time Breakdown

| Task | Topic | Time |
|------|-------|------|
| 2.1 | Prepare Your Recording Setup | 5 min |
| 2.2 | Record Your Demo | 10 min |
| 2.3 | Pair Up and Practice | 10 min |
| 2.4 | Give and Receive Feedback | 5 min |
| | **TOTAL** | **30 min** |

---

## Task 2.1: Prepare Your Recording Setup (5 min)

1. **Choose your recording tool:**
   - **macOS:** QuickTime Player (File > New Screen Recording)
   - **Windows:** Windows + G (Game Bar) or OBS
   - **Cross-platform:** Loom, OBS Studio

2. **Set up your screen:**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Clear desktop notifications
   - Open only the windows you need:
     - Terminal with Claude Code ready
     - Any output destinations (browser, files)
     - Sample data files

3. **Test audio:**
   - Select correct microphone
   - Do a quick test recording (10 seconds)
   - Check playback volume

4. **Checklist before recording:**

| Item | Ready? |
|------|--------|
| Recording tool open | [ ] |
| Microphone selected | [ ] |
| Notifications disabled | [ ] |
| Sample data ready | [ ] |
| Agent tested and working | [ ] |

---

## Task 2.2: Record Your Demo (10 min)

Record a 3-minute walkthrough of your agent in action.

**Recording checklist:**
- [ ] State your name and project name at the start
- [ ] Show the input you're giving the agent
- [ ] Narrate what's happening as the agent works
- [ ] Show the final output
- [ ] Keep it under 3 minutes

**Recording tips:**
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Pause after important points
- If something fails, keep recording and explain what should happen
- You can edit later, but a single take is often better

**Script for your recording:**
1. "Hi, I'm [name] and this is [project name]"
2. "I'm going to show you [what]"
3. "Here's my input: [show input]"
4. [Run agent, narrate as it works]
5. "And here's the result: [show output]"

**Save your recording as:** `demo-backup-[yourname].mp4`

### Verify your recording:
- [ ] File plays back correctly
- [ ] Audio is audible and clear
- [ ] Agent output is visible
- [ ] Duration is under 3 minutes

---

## Task 2.3: Pair Up and Practice (10 min)

Find a partner. Each person presents while the other times and takes notes.

**For the presenter:**
- Present your full 5-minute demo
- Use your outline as a guide
- Practice transitioning between sections
- Use your recorded backup if the live demo fails

**For the observer:**
- Start a timer when they begin
- Note when they hit each section
- Write down:
  - One thing that was clear and compelling
  - One thing that was confusing
  - One suggestion for improvement

**Timing notes template:**

| Section | Target | Actual | Notes |
|---------|--------|--------|-------|
| Problem | 0:30 | | |
| Solution | 1:30 | | |
| Demo | 4:00 | | |
| Learnings | 5:00 | | |

**No partner available?**
- Record yourself presenting
- Watch the playback
- Note your own timing and areas to improve

---

## Task 2.4: Give and Receive Feedback (5 min)

After both partners present, share feedback using this framework:

**What Worked Well:**
- Specific things that impressed you
- Clever solutions or clear explanations
- Good use of concepts from the course

**Questions I Had:**
- Clarifying questions about the implementation
- How would it handle edge cases?
- Scalability or reliability considerations

**Suggestions:**
- Ideas for the presentation (not the code)
- How to make the demo clearer
- What to cut if running long

### Feedback Template

**Feedback for: _______________**

| Category | Notes |
|----------|-------|
| What worked well | |
| Questions I had | |
| Suggestion | |

## Troubleshooting

### Recording Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| No audio in recording | Check microphone selected in recording app |
| Recording too large | Use a lower resolution or compress with HandBrake |
| Screen not captured | Grant screen recording permission in System Preferences |
| Choppy playback | Close other applications, restart and re-record |

### Demo Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Agent hangs during demo | Show backup recording, explain what should happen |
| Wrong output | Acknowledge it, explain expected output, move on |
| Takes too long | Prepare a "skip ahead" version with cached output |
| Nervous/rushed | Breathe, slow down, focus on one section at a time |

### Practice Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Running way over time | Cut the solution section, go straight to demo |
| Not sure what to say | Read your outline, don't improvise until comfortable |
| Partner's feedback harsh | Focus on actionable suggestions, ignore tone |
| No partner available | Record yourself and watch playback |

- [ ] Notifications disabled on demo machine

**Presentation Ready:**
- [ ] Practiced at least once with a partner
- [ ] Received and incorporated feedback
- [ ] Know your time slot (if assigned)
- [ ] Confident with opening line and transitions

**Document your preparation:**

| Item | Status |

| Backup recording file | |
| Timing during practice | |
| Key feedback received | |
| Adjustment made | |

## Reference: Demo Dos and Don'ts

### Do

| Action | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Prepare a backup recording | Live demos fail 30% of the time |
| Have sample data ready | Avoids scrambling during demo |
| Keep it concise | Respect everyone's time |
| Show real output | The output is the star, not your code |
| Acknowledge limitations | Builds credibility |

### Don't

| Action | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Read from slides | You know your project, talk naturally |
| Spend too long on setup | Get to the demo quickly |
| Apologize for "rough" work | Undermines your credibility |
| Skip the demo | Everyone wants to see it work |
| Go over time | Others are waiting |

---

## Reference: Feedback Framework

### Giving Feedback

**Structure:**
1. Start with something specific that impressed you
2. Ask clarifying questions (not challenges)
3. Offer one constructive suggestion

**Good feedback examples:**
- "The way you handled the multi-step workflow was really elegant."
- "I'm curious how it would handle edge case X?"
- "Have you considered adding Y? It might help with Z."

**Avoid:**
- "I would have done it completely differently..."
- "That's not how I understood the assignment..."
- "Why didn't you use X technology?"

### Receiving Feedback

- Say "thank you" first
- Write down suggestions (even if you disagree)
- Ask for clarification if feedback is vague
- Don't defend or explain unless asked
