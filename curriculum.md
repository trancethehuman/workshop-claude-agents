# Workshop Series: AI for Data Science

**Duration:** 8 weeks, 3 hours per session, weekly
**Format:** Virtual (Zoom)
**Languages:** TypeScript and Python
**Prerequisites:** Claude Pro subscription, GitHub account, TypeScript or Python familiarity

---

## Series Overview

This workshop teaches developers to build AI agents for data analytics and GTM (Go-to-Market) engineering using Claude Code and Claude Agent SDK.

**What You'll Build:**
- Custom tools and MCP integrations for data and GTM workflows
- Agent Skills that extend Claude's capabilities
- Sub-agent systems for complex multi-step tasks
- Headless agents that run at scale
- Eval dashboards to measure and improve agent quality

**What You'll Learn:**
- Tool calling fundamentals and patterns
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) for external integrations
- Agent Skills specification and best practices
- Sub-agent orchestration with the Task tool
- Claude Agent SDK for headless/fleet operation
- Evaluation frameworks for agent quality

## Capstone Project

Participants build an agent system within one of these domains:

**Data Analytics:**
- Automated data profiling and cleaning
- Report generation pipelines
- Anomaly detection agents

**GTM Engineering:**
- Lead enrichment and scoring
- Personalized outreach automation
- Pipeline intelligence and forecasting

Projects are developed incrementally each week and presented in Week 8.
