## What You'll Learn

This hands-on workshop takes you from zero to production-ready AI agents. By the end, you'll have built a working agent for your specific domain, whether that's GTM, data analytics, customer support, or operations.

## Weekly Curriculum

| Week | Topic | What You Build |
|------|-------|----------------|

| 3 | MCP Integration | Connect external services (Gmail, Notion, GitHub) |

## Who This Is For

- Business operators wanting to automate repetitive tasks
- Developers exploring AI agent patterns
- GTM teams building sales and marketing automation
- Data analysts creating intelligent data pipelines
- Anyone who wants to build practical AI tools

## What Makes This Different

This is not a lecture series. Every session includes:

- Live coding and demonstrations
- Hands-on labs where you build real agents
- Capstone project development time
- Peer learning and collaboration

You leave with a working agent, not just knowledge.
