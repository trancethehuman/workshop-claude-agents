| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Overall Net Revenue Retention | **130.3%** |
| Enterprise NRR | 134.0% |
| Mid-Market NRR | 118.6% |

## Churn Leading Indicators

Analysis of 4 churned accounts reveals consistent pre-churn patterns emerging 2-3 months before cancellation:

| Signal | Normal Period | Pre-Churn Period | Change |
|--------|:------------:|:----------------:|:------:|
| Monthly Logins | 142 | 96 | **-33%** |
| Support Tickets | 6.7/mo | 16.2/mo | **+144%** |
| NPS Score | 55 | 17 | **-38 pts** |

The pattern is clear: usage drops, frustration rises (tickets spike), and satisfaction craters — in that order.

## Accounts Requiring Immediate Attention

| Rank | Company | Segment | MRR | Risk Score | Key Signals | Owner |
|:----:|---------|---------|----:|:---------:|-------------|-------|
| 1 | **MediaGroup Digital** | SMB | $2,207 | 50.3 | Logins -24%, Tickets +50% | Alice Johnson |
| 2 | **EcoSystems Ltd** | SMB | $887 | 43.3 | Logins -43% | Bob Smith |
| 3 | **TechBridge Solutions** | SMB | $2,252 | 40.9 | Logins -41% | Carol Williams |

### Recommended Actions

**1. MediaGroup Digital** — Risk Score: 50.3
- Login activity down 24% with a simultaneous 50% spike in support tickets — this matches the exact pre-churn pattern we saw in churned accounts
- **Action:** Alice Johnson should schedule an executive check-in this week. The ticket spike suggests product friction — loop in a solutions engineer to review their setup

**2. EcoSystems Ltd** — Risk Score: 43.3
- Logins have dropped 43%, the steepest decline in the portfolio. At $887 MRR this is a small account, but the pattern is a textbook disengagement signal
- **Action:** Bob Smith should trigger a re-engagement campaign — product walkthrough of features they're not using, with a usage health check

**3. TechBridge Solutions** — Risk Score: 40.9
- 41% login drop. Unlike MediaGroup, tickets are flat — which may mean they've already mentally checked out rather than fighting with the product
- **Action:** Carol Williams should reach out directly. Silent disengagement is harder to recover than vocal frustration. Offer a quarterly business review to realign on value

## Notable Observation

All 3 at-risk accounts are SMB. This segment has the lowest NRR (111.6%) and appears most susceptible to quiet churn. Consider whether the SMB segment is getting adequate CSM coverage relative to Enterprise and Mid-Market.
