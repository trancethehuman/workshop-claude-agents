# Kahoot: Week 1 - Overview & Setup

## Question 1: What is the key difference between a chatbot and an agent?

- ☐ Agents use bigger language models than chatbots
- ☐ Chatbots can access the internet, agents cannot
- ☐ An agent autonomously plans, acts, and iterates — a chatbot just responds
- ☐ Agents only work with structured data

## Question 2: What is the correct order of the Agent Loop?

- ☐ Execute → Think → Observe → Select Tool → Input
- ☐ Input → Think → Select Tool → Execute → Observe
- ☐ Input → Select Tool → Execute → Think → Observe
- ☐ Think → Input → Observe → Execute → Select Tool

## Question 3: Why is Claude Code described as "filesystem-native"?

- ☐ It was built specifically for managing file systems
- ☐ It can only read and write files, not do other tasks
- ☐ LLMs have seen bash, grep, and find billions of times during training
- ☐ It requires a local file system to function

## Question 4: What happened when Vercel reduced their agent's tools from many to fewer?

- ☐ The agent became slower but more accurate
- ☐ The agent could no longer complete tasks
- ☐ They achieved 100% success rate and 3.5x faster execution
- ☐ They needed to add more tools back within a week

## Question 5: How many layers are in the Claude Agent Stack?

- ☐ 3 (Tool Calling → MCP → Agent SDK)
- ☐ 4 (Tool Calling → MCP → Sub-agents → Agent SDK)
- ☐ 5 (Tool Calling → MCP → Agent Skills → Sub-agents → Agent SDK)
- ☐ 7 (Tool Calling → MCP → RAG → Skills → Sub-agents → Evals → Agent SDK)

## Question 6: What does GTM Engineering refer to in the context of this course?

- ☐ A Google Tag Manager certification program
- ☐ Go-To-Market Engineering — using AI agents for sales, marketing, and business automation
- ☐ A general technology management framework
- ☐ A type of database engineering for marketing teams

## Question 7: What is the purpose of the CLAUDE.md file?

- ☐ It contains the source code for Claude's language model
- ☐ It is a log file that records all agent interactions
- ☐ It customizes Claude's behavior and provides project-specific instructions
- ☐ It stores API keys and authentication tokens

## Question 8: Which statement best describes why fewer tools lead to better agent performance?

- ☐ Fewer tools use less memory on the computer
- ☐ Fewer tools make the code easier to debug
- ☐ The agent spends less time deciding which tool to use, reducing errors and token usage
- ☐ Fewer tools are cheaper to license from vendors
