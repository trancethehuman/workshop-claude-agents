# Week 8: Demos
## Showcase and Learn from Each Other

---

# Session Goals

- Present capstone projects to the group
- Learn from different approaches and implementations
- Give and receive constructive feedback
- Celebrate what everyone has built

---

# Demo Format

**5 minutes:** Presentation and demo
**2 minutes:** Q&A and feedback

**Structure:**
1. The Problem (30 sec)
2. The Solution (1 min)
3. Live Demo (2.5 min)
4. Learnings (1 min)

---

# The Problem (30 seconds)

**Your opening line sets the tone. Lead with the impact, not the technology.**

Start with:
- What manual process you automated
- What pain point you solved
- What bottleneck you removed

Example: "Our sales team spent 2 hours per day researching companies manually..."

---

# The Solution (1 minute)

**High-level architecture:**
- What tools/skills/agents you built
- How they work together
- Key design decisions

Keep it simple. Save technical details for Q&A.

---

# Live Demo (2.5 minutes)

**Show, don't tell:**
- Run your agent on real data
- Show actual output
- Highlight the key capability

**Pro tip:** Have a backup recording in case of live demo issues

---

# Learnings (1 minute)

**What did you discover?**
- What worked well
- What surprised you
- What you'd do differently
- What's next for this project

---

# Backup Recording

**Live demos fail 30% of the time.**

A backup recording turns a disaster into a smooth transition.

Record a 2-minute screen capture showing:
1. Your agent receiving input
2. The agent working (tools, reasoning)
3. Final output

---

# Demo Prep Lab

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**What you'll do:**
- Create your 5-minute demo outline
- Record a backup demo video
- Practice with a partner and get timing feedback
- Complete the final demo checklist

---

# Feedback Framework

**What Worked Well:**
- Specific things that impressed you
- Clever solutions or approaches
- Good use of concepts from the course

**Questions:**
- Clarifying questions about implementation
- How would it handle edge cases?

**Suggestions:**
- Ideas for improvement
- Alternative approaches

---

# Demo Session I

**8 demos × 7 minutes = 56 minutes**

| # | Time |
|---|------|
| 1-8 | 5+2 min each |

---

# **BREAK**
## 10 minutes

# Retrospective

**What did we learn?**

Go around and share one key insight:
- "I learned that..."
- "I was surprised by..."
- "I want to try..."

# Your Journey

- **Week 1:** Defined a project and learned the basics
- **Week 2:** Mastered tool calling and research
- **Week 3:** Connected to real data via MCP
- **Week 4:** Encoded expertise as skills
- **Week 5:** Orchestrated sub-agents
- **Week 6:** Ran agents programmatically
- **Week 7:** Built evals to ensure quality
- **Week 8:** Shipped a working agent for your domain

Everyone built something different, but everyone learned the same core patterns.
